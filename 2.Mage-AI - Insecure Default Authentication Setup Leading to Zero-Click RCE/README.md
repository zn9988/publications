# Description
The application lacks proper user authentication by default, allowing anyone to access it without authentication. Although there is an option to enable user authentication, it is not prominently displayed, and users may not be aware of its existence. This oversight poses a significant vulnerability. The absence of proper authentication opens the door for unauthorized access. An attacker could achieve zero-click remote code execution (RCE) due to this flaw. Essentially, an attacker can exploit the lack of authentication to execute arbitrary code without any user interaction. This represents a severe risk; this can lead to a compromise of the web service or the server.

-----------------------------
# Proof Of Concept

1. In the pipeline feature, you can add a custom Python block and there was not restriction on the import modules. This block can be used to execute OS commands on the target machine by importing the OS module.

**Figure 1: Add custom Python block with the importing the OS module**

2. Execute the Python script within the block to run an OS command. Store the output of this command in a file named /tmp/abc. Verify the success of this attack by examining the OS command output in the file.

4. To demonstrate the maximum impact of this vulnerability, we developed an exploitation script that can exploit the vulnerability to achieve remote code execution (RCE) with a single command.

# Recommendation & Workaround


We initially reported this issue to the Mage-AI, recommending that authentication be enabled by default during the application's setup process. This would ensure that users are protected out of the box, reducing the risk of unauthenticated access. However, **Mage-AI did not acknowledge this as a security vulnerability**, despite evidence showing that **multiple real-world instances** are affected. Given the potential risk to unaware users, **we are publicly disclosing this information to raise awareness and help users secure their deployments**.

## Workaround Solution
To protect your instance from unauthorised access and RCE, it is critical to manually enable authentication in your deployment. Since authentication is not enabled by default, users must explicitly configure it to secure their instances.

**How to Enable Authentication**
Set the following environment variable when running the application:

``-e REQUIRE_USER_AUTHENTICATION=1``

For full configuration details, refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.mage.ai/production/authentication/overview).


Since authentication settings are not prominently displayed during the application's setup, many users may  be unknowingly deploy the application in an default insecure state. We strongly urge all users to verify their authentication settings and apply the necessary configuration changes immediately.

# Threat Research Information â€“ Live Vulnerable Instances on The Internet

We performed threat research analysis on the internet to discover vulnerable live instances, using the HTTP response of the Mage-AI application as an indicator. Based on the OSINT results from the Censys, Shodan, FOFA, ZoomEye a total **1045 instances** were found to be publicly accessible on the internet. They are potentially vulnerable to this vulnerability. If performing active reconnaissance on the internet might potentially uncover more instances.

To automate the process of discovering unauthenticated Mage-AI application, we created a harmless Nuclei template to scan for this vulnerability. Nuclei returns results from vulnerable instances, indicating whether the Mage-AI application has authentication enabled. If the Mage-AI application does not have authentication enabled and is further exploited, this vulnerability could potentially lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the target. The [Nuclei template CVE-2025-2129](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/196ed9fe70b0f5d9b312c66ffa49ccd648e56a9e/http/cves/2025/CVE-2025-2129.yaml) has been published in Nuclei Vulnerability Scanner to help verify this vulnerability as a contribution to the security community.

Based on our OSINT results, we randomly selected a few and found that three of them were susceptible to this potential vulnerability. Performing active reconnaissance on the internet could uncover even more vulnerable instances. Additionally, this issue might also affect systems hosted on enterprise internal networks.
